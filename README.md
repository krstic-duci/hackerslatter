## Notes - some things are omitted on purpose:
- Due to the simplicity of a demo, I decide to use Bootstrap to save up time for common classes
- I could also use a classname package for a "nicer" way of writing className
- I decide to put all files into components, but they could be easily separate via purpose (for example)
  ```
  src/News/NewsStory
  ```
- I could also improve paths to certain folders i.e `../../styles` to become `@styles`
- In the `api/index.ts` there could be definitely some better error handling
- In the real world project I would probably use some third-party lib for auto generating *Request* and *Response* from back-end
